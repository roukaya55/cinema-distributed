Blockchain and RabbitMQ Integration Explanation

In this project, the blockchain and RabbitMQ are used together to achieve two main goals: secure integration and trusted transaction management across distributed microservices. The blockchain ensures the integrity of each transaction, while RabbitMQ guarantees asynchronous communication and service coordination.

When a user performs a payment, the Payment Service records the transaction and sends it to the Blockchain Service, which creates a new payment block inside the blockchain database. This block contains the transaction details and a cryptographic hash that links it to the previous block, ensuring immutability. Once the payment block is created, the Blockchain Service publishes a message (e.g., "payment.confirmed") to RabbitMQ.

The Payment Service, which listens to this event, updates the transaction status to "Success" and then publishes another message "payment.success". Both the Booking Service and the Movie Service subscribe to this message. When they receive it, the Booking Service confirms the booking and reserves the selected seats, while the Movie Service updates seat availability accordingly.

After completing the booking, the Booking Service sends another message "booking.created" back to the Blockchain Service. The blockchain then creates a second block — a booking block — to record that the booking and seat reservation have been successfully completed. This makes both the payment and booking operations verifiable and tamper-proof.

This flow aligns with the project requirements:

RabbitMQ provides distributed integration between services.

Blockchain ensures transparency and trust in both payment and booking operations.

Payment Service handles the transaction itself, while Blockchain Service guarantees the integrity of that transaction and the booking lifecycle.

This architecture demonstrates how microservices, message queues, and a custom blockchain can work together to create a distributed, reliable, and auditable system.
